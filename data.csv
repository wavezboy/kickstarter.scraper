Currently, the number one issue facing academic scientific training institutions is the immense overpopulation of young scientists pursuing a “traditional” scientific career.  This “traditional” path usually includes 5-7 years of graduate studies followed by one or more post-doctoral fellowships that last until the individual can publish in a high enough impact journal to secure a rare faculty position.  However, according to a 2014 National Academies report, where 65% of US PhD-holders continue into a postdoc, only 15–20% of those move into tenure-track academic posts.  An immensely large bottleneck has formed, leaving almost 50% of the highly qualified, advanced-degree holding scientists to compete for dwindling industrial science positions.  We believe the answer to this growing issue partially lies in building “alternative” opportunities for the advanced graduate student."
